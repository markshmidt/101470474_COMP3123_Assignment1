## Project Overview

This project implements a RESTful API for basic User and Employee Management, using:

- Node.js + Express.js as the backend framework

- MongoDB (Atlas) as the database

- Mongoose as the ODM

- bcryptjs for password hashing

- jsonwebtoken (JWT) for authentication

The backend supports CRUD operations for Employees and Signup/Login for Users, following REST principles and returning appropriate HTTP status codes.
